# 📈 CoinVista: Real-Time Cryptocurrency Tracker

## 🌟 Overview

**CoinVista** is a modern, responsive web application designed to track the top cryptocurrencies in real-time. Built on a robust **React** architecture, this project demonstrates state management using the **Context API**, dynamic API integration with **CoinGecko**, and professional UI/UX practices.

The website allows users to view current prices, market capitalization, 24-hour price changes, and historical price charts, all updated dynamically based on the user's selected fiat currency.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-Time Data:** Fetches and displays market data for the **Top 10 Cryptocurrencies** directly from the CoinGecko API.
* **Dynamic Currency Switching:** Users can instantly convert all displayed prices between **USD ($\$)**, **Euro (€)**, and **Indian Rupee (₹)**.
* **Detailed Coin View:** Dedicated pages for each coin showing comprehensive market data (rank, cap, high/low) and an L-interactive price chart.
* **Historical Charts:** Uses **React Google Charts** to visualize the coin's price history over the past 10 days.
* **Live Search & Filtering:** Efficient search functionality with real-time suggestions and filtering of the coin list.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | `ReactJS` (Functional Components) | Core user interface development and component logic. |
| **State Management** | `React Context API` | Global management of coin data and selected currency state. |
| **Routing** | `React Router DOM` | Single Page Application (SPA) navigation and URL management. |
| **Data Visualization** | `react-google-charts` | Renders line charts for historical price data. |
| **API** | `CoinGecko API` | Provides real-time and historical cryptocurrency market data. |
| **Deployment** | `Hostinger` | Hosting platform for the final production build. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
* A stable code editor (e.g., VS Code)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/coin-vista.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/coin-vista.git)
    cd coin-vista
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **API Setup (`.env.local`):**
    While the basic CoinGecko calls might work without a key, for sustained use or specific rate limits, you may need one. Create a file named **`.env.local`** in the root of your project directory to store environment variables securely.

    ```
    # Example placeholder for API Key
    # VITE_COINGECKO_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE 
    ```

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be running locally at the address provided in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## ☁️ Deployment

The application is optimized for deployment as a static build on platforms like Hostinger, Vercel, or Netlify.

1.  **Build Production Files:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates the production-ready files (typically in a `dist` folder).

2.  **Uploading to Hostinger:**
    Upload the contents of the generated build folder to your web server's public HTML directory using Hostinger's file manager or FTP.
